We're building an exhibit at Museum of Digital Arts and Entertainment (MADE https://www.themade.org/) to show the history of First Person Shooter games.
One of the games in this exhibit will be MazeWar on the PDP-10. Emulated on a Raspberry PI using https://github.com/obsolescence/pidp10.
Mazewar is one of the first multi-player games. We can't practically have multiple players for this exhibit and without an opponent, Mazewar is not interesting, I'm writing a bot to provide one or more enemies.
